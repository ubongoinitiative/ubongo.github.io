The organizers met with Prof. Richard Brown at the Alzheimer’s Association’s Dementia and Brain Aging in Low- and Middle Income Countries on December 8th 2022, and invited him to give a public lecture on the 13th of December 2022. The organizing committee came up with the idea of medical, dental, and pharmacy students and a preliminary program on the event was designed. This program was discussed with the advisors with respect to the activities, key speaker, date, venue, and source of funds.

The student target groups were identified and formal letters were written to the Dean Faculty of Health Sciences for approval of the venue, Lecture Theatre 3, and use of the university’s projector for the public lecture. The organizing committee rolled out Google forms across WhatsApp groups, Instagram, Telegram, and school emails for publicity and for student engagement.


# Objectives

1. Elevate mental health awareness among Kenyan youth, specifically targeting those in high school and medical school.
2. Educate students on the significance of brain health within the broader context of overall well-being, while also introducing the potential of a career in neuroscience.
3. Motivate the younger generation to emerge as the forthcoming cadre of neuroscientists, psychologists, physicians, and thought leaders. These individuals will be pivotal in advancing research, shaping policy, and devising effective interventions.
