The organizing committee invited Dr. Michael Magoha for a fire side chat on 'Advancements in Neuroscience' that was scheduled for March 16, 2023.

The committee devised an inclusive plan to involve medical, dental, and pharmacy students. An initial event program was sketched out, and after thorough discussions with advisors regarding the activities, main speaker, date, venue, and funding, the final program was crafted.


# Objectives

1. Elevate mental health awareness among Kenyan youth, specifically targeting those in high school and medical school.
2. Educate students on the significance of brain health within the broader context of overall well-being, while also introducing the potential of a career in neuroscience.
3. Motivate the younger generation to emerge as the forthcoming cadre of neuroscientists, psychologists, physicians, and thought leaders. These individuals will be pivotal in advancing research, shaping policy, and devising effective interventions.
