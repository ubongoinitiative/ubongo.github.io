Panelist discussion on ‘A Career in Neuroscience’ at the University of Nairobi’s Kenyatta National Hospital campus in Nairobi, Kenya. We organized and held this hybrid public lecture on 12th May 2022 from 1600 hours to 1900 hours GMT +3, at the University of Nairobi’s Kenyatta National Hospital campus in Nairobi, Kenya. We invited medical students across all academic years to our hybrid event by engaging them through Twitter, WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. Inviting expert panelists to contextualize neuroscience. We invited Prof. Amadi Ihunwo, Dr. Michael Magoha (a neurosurgeon), Dr. Kitunguu Kithikii (a neurosurgeon), and Dr. Chitayi Mirabula (a neuropsychiatrist) to our forum, and facilitated a networking session where experts and students shared thoughts on neuroscience. We finalized with an open discussion forum where realtime questions and surveyed questions were answered by our panelists.

# Objectives

1. Elevate mental health awareness among Kenyan youth, specifically targeting those in high school and medical school.
2. Educate students on the significance of brain health within the broader context of overall well-being, while also introducing the potential of a career in neuroscience.
3. Motivate the younger generation to emerge as the forthcoming cadre of neuroscientists, psychologists, physicians, and thought leaders. These individuals will be pivotal in advancing research, shaping policy, and devising effective interventions.
