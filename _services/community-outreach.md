Community outreach programme to Ushirika and Shammah High Schools in Kibera which are schools within Kibera, an informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya on 11th June 2022. We recruited volunteers from the University of Nairobi’s intercalated Bachelor of Science in Physiology and Anatomy programmes and medical school who instructed the students on neurophysiology, on neuroanatomy, and on neuroscience. We also organized a career talk and break out rooms with a targeted and personalized approach where volunteers shared anecdotes and words of encouragement to guide our students on their paths to neuroscience. We documented the day’s events through photography and videography, and sharing our work across LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, and WhatsApp platforms.



# Objectives

1. Elevate mental health awareness among Kenyan youth, specifically targeting those in high school and medical school.
2. Educate students on the significance of brain health within the broader context of overall well-being, while also introducing the potential of a career in neuroscience.
3. Motivate the younger generation to emerge as the forthcoming cadre of neuroscientists, psychologists, physicians, and thought leaders. These individuals will be pivotal in advancing research, shaping policy, and devising effective interventions.
4. Prioritize engagement with students from underprivileged schools, ensuring equitable distribution and awareness of neuroscience knowledge throughout Kenya.
