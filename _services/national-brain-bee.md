The organizers came up with the idea of targeting high school students and a preliminary program on the event was designed. This program was discussed with the advisors with respect to the activities, key speakers, dates, venue, and source of funds (IBRO and AMSUN).

# Objectives

1. Elevate mental health awareness among Kenyan youth, specifically targeting those in high school and medical school.
2. Educate students on the significance of brain health within the broader context of overall well-being, while also introducing the potential of a career in neuroscience.
3. Motivate the younger generation to emerge as the forthcoming cadre of neuroscientists, psychologists, physicians, and thought leaders. These individuals will be pivotal in advancing research, shaping policy, and devising effective interventions.

## Preparations

The student target group was identified and formal letters were written to ten schools from which students would be chosen. The schools were requested to allow 4 students to attend the event as a number higher than that would have been difficult to handle due limited equipment and space. For effectiveness, letters were delivered by hand to the respective schools with the help of the organizers. During delivery of the letters, communication with the head teachers of each school was done following which confirmation of attendance was to be emailed to the Ubongo campaign Gmail account from the respective schools. Out of the 10 schools that were invited, 7 confirmed their attendance and came. The two remaining schools (Kenya High, Nova Pioneer Boys’, and Nova Pioneer Girls’ Schools) of the schools declined following the scheduling of other events on the same day as the day on which the Ubongo campaign would be.
